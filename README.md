# Using the Tesla API with Postman

**PLEASE READ STEPS DOCUMENTATION BEFORE ATTEMPTING AUTHENTICATION.**  The authentication sequence follows the sequence outlined [here](https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/api-basics/authentication).  Familarity with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is recommended. You must obtain an access token through one of two methods.

1. Use Authentication (Without MFA) if your account does not have MFA enabled, and to observe each authentication step directly.
2. Use Authentcation (With or Without MFA) if your account has MFA enabled, or if you do not want to store your account credentials in Postman. This process will use a browser based session on Tesla's website to generate the access token.

Note that some authentication information is time sensitive so the steps should be completed in a five minute period.
## Authentcation (Without MFA)
### Step 3 will fail without MFA support. If your account has MFA enabled, skip to 

### Step 1: Request Log In Page

USER PREPARATION: Enter the email address used to access your Telsa account in the parameter named login_hint.  Enter a random string in the parameter named state.  Save these changes before clicking Send.

#### Documentation

All parameters have been defined.  Update the state and login_hint as described in USER PREPARATION.

The Pre-request Script creates the code verifier and code challenge required for the API calls.

The Tests extract hidden form variables from the response and stores them in envrionment variables for subsequent calls.

### Step 2: Obtain Authorization Code

USER PREPARATION: Enter a random string in the parameter named state.  This should be the same value used in the Request Log In Page call (step 1).  On the Body tab, enter your Tesla Log In ID for the identity key, and enter your Tesla Log In password for the credential key.   Save these changes before clicking Send.

#### Documentation

All parameters have been defined.  Update the state parameter and Body keys as described in USER PREPARATION.

The Body defines form variables sent with the call.  Some form variables are assigned from environment variables; the Tesla Log In credentials are updated as described in USER PREPARATION.

The Tests extract an authentication code and stores it in the environment variable named code.

### Step 3: Exchange Authentication Code for Bearer Token

#### Documentation

The Body defines a JSON document containing the authentication code received in step 2 and the code verifier created in step 1.

The Tests extract the access token and stores it in the environment variable named access_token.

### Step 4: Exchange Bearer Token for Access Token

USER PREPARATION: Enter the client ID and secret before clicking Send. The current client ID and secret are [available here](https://pastebin.com/pS7Z6yyP).

#### Documentation

The Authorization is set to Bearer Token and Token is assigned from the environment variable access_token.

The Body defines a JSON document for the call.  Update the client ID and secret as described in USER PREPARATION.

The Tests extract access and refresh tokens.  The access token is stored in the environment variable named teslaBearerToken.  The refresh token is stored in the environment variable named teslaRefreshToken.

## Authentcation (With or Without MFA)
### Step 1: Setup Environment

USER PREPARATION: Obtain the Client_ID and Client_Secret for the Telsa Owners API which can be found [here](https://www.teslaapi.io/authentication/oauth).

#### Documentation

Open the environment variables in Postman and updated the current value for clientid and clientsecret with the values obtained in the User Preparation section. Save and close environment variables.

Open the Get Access Token with MFA request. Click on the Authorization tab. Update the State variable with a random string of characters.

### Step 2: Obtain Authorization Token from the Tesla SSO server

NOTE: The token will expire after 5 minutes. If you do not perform step 3 in that time frame you will be required to repeat this step.

#### Documentation

In the Get Access Token with MFA request, under the Authorization tab, scroll down to the bottom and click Get New Access Token.

A new browser based window will open to the Tesla SSO website. Enter your Tesla credentials and satisfy MFA if you have it enabled on your account.

The window will automatically close, and Postman will display the authorization token it received. Click on Use Token.

### Step 3: Exchange Authorization Token for Access Token
#### Documentation

In the Get Access Token with MFA request, click on Send.

The Tests extract access and refresh tokens.  The access token is stored in the environment variable named teslaBearerToken.  The refresh token is stored in the environment variable named teslaRefreshToken.

NOTE: This refresh token cannot be used to refresh your access token. You must repeate Step 2 to obtain a new Authorization token, then repeat this step to obtain a new token.

## Using the APIs

The APIs make use of the Bearer Token that was provided through the steps executed in Authentication.  If the Bearer Token is not available, API calls will fail.

### Get Vehicles

NOTE: Use Get Vehicles first.

The Get Vehicles call retrieves a list of vehicles on your Tesla account.  It extracts the id_s variable for the first vehicle and stores it in the teslaVehicleIdS environment variable.  Without this value, other API calls will fail.  Once id_s has been retrieved, Get Vehicles should not be needed again.

### Wake Vehicle

The Wake Vehicle call wakes a sleeping vehicle.  A vehicle must be online to respond to requests for vehicle information.

The Tests contains a check named Vehicle On-Line Check.  If the test passes, the vehicle is online.

### Get Vehicle Data

The Get Vehicle Data call retrieves all available data for the vehicle defined by the teslaVehicleIdS environment variable.
